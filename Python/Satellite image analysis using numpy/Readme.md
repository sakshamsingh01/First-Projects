# Satellite Image Analysis using Numpy
## -By: Vrinda Gupta

### How it was made and Instructions to use:

In this I am creating different filters for an image by changing intensity of it's red,blue and green pixel by using Numpy library in Python 3.
I just used some basic built-in functions of numpy library imported them and just by varing the pixels of the three primary colors red,blue and green formed filters.
