# OpenCV
## -By: Viivek Uppalapu

### How it was made and Instructions to use:

The project was made by taking reference from official OpenCV documentation for Python. Created 4 different files for Face detection, shape detection, color detection and virtually paint over your screen.
As a requirement, please open terminal and type the following commands:
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy

We're good to go!

Run the required file and see the magic!
