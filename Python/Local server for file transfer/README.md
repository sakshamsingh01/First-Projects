### A local server for file transfer

## By: @letiendat198

# How it was made and instruction to use:
  - Be sure to have:
    - Python 3
    - Flask and Werkzeug library (You can install it via pip)
  - Run the server.py file. The server will operate at *localhost:5000* (You can access the server from another device within a same network by visiting *your_machine_local_ip:5000*).

  - This was created when I needed a way to share file in a local network easily and without using a third party service/cloud.
