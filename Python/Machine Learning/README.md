# Machine learning
## -By: Viswanadh Kothakota

### How it was made and Instructions to use:

These models are useful to get knowledge on various algorithms in ML and these models are made by taking reference from various resources.
Go through .ipynb(python Notebooks) to gain more knowledge on some of Algoriths in ML like:
Linear Regression,
DecisionTree,
RandomForest,
k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN).
The datasets which are used in notebooks are also attached along with notebooks.


So, Run .ipynb's do some changes, gain some knowledge!
Keep on Learning...
