Talk To Me (1.0) is the very first version of this game series I have created for my pre-intermediate (class 11th) project in 2017. As I was just learning the basics of programming in Turbo C++, this was my first project where I learned and implemented graphics and C++ language concepts to build this game. 

To run this program, you need to have Turbo C++ to be installed in your system. For windows, I have already provided the software which you use to install this software.

Have Fun!
