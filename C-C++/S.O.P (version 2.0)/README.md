# S.O.P (version 2.0)
  
This is the project I made for my 12th (Intermediate) standard final project. Which is also an upgradation of my 11th standard project which got lost in the dust. Hope you like it as a program written by a new programmer.  
  
To execute this file, you will have to do a few things manually since it's one of the first projects that I made and hence I didn't knew much about making installation and executables. You will have to make on folder directly under your C: drive named 'S.O.P (version 2.0)' and then extract all the files and folders of this repository into that folder. After that, you can execute the project with the executable and it should work. :)
