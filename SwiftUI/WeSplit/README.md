## -By: chirathkdev

### How it was made and Instructions to use:

The project was made using official SwiftUI documentation and the help from Great Paul Hudson at Hacking With Swift.

Just open the project from Xcode 11 or 12 and Run in any selected simulator or device to run the app. It is a simple app to split costs among friends.
